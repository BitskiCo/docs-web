At Bitski, we’re on a mission to make the commerce layer of the metaverse
accessible to everyone. Which is just a fancy way of saying we're passionate
about making it easy for anyone to own, create, sell or use digital things in
the metaverse, regardless of previous blockchain experience.

Since a fundamental part of enabling economic activity in the metaverse is the
ability to own, purchase and use digital things, we made a kick-ass wallet to
support those needs.

Here’s what sets our wallet apart:

- **Simple + Secure User Wallet:** We secure all user wallets in special
  hardware devices called Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). These are physically
  protected in biometric-secure data centers that are regionally distributed
  across the US (Asia & Europe coming soon). Bitski is the only company that
  offers a hardware-backed wallet that users and developers can access anywhere,
  anytime. (We even hire white-hat hackers to find any potential security risks
  so we're constantly upping our security game!)
- **Metaverse Compatibility:** We offer a single sign-on (SSO) and OAuth
  compliant wallet that can easily integrate into games, social platforms and
  more so your NFTs can live outside of your wallet. Bitski's wallet also plugs
  directly into top secondary markets like OpenSea.
- **Never Worry about Lost Keys:** Bitski's keys never leave the hardware, so
  there's always a way to safely recover passwords for users. This means no seed
  phrases to remember or the need to dig through a landfill in case you
  accidentally toss out a physical key!

## Let's take a tour.

From your wallet home screen, you can:

- View your NFTs
- Check your ETH balance
- Track wallet activity
- Send and receive ETH
- Purchase ETH
- Transfer NFTs
- Adjust settings
- Get support
- Access the Creator Portal

**Here's what your wallet dashboard may look like on the "Collected" tab. This
view shows all the NFTs that you own.**

This is the default view that appears when you click into your wallet. To return
to this view, select "Collected" from the menu on the top left.

**Click over to the "Currencies" tab and you'll see all your magic internet
money (aka Ethereum).**

**You can also click "Activity" to take a look at ETH you have sent or received.
If you've bought or sold any NFTs recently, you'll also notice "Contract
Interactions." That's just a fancy way of saying something happened on
blockchain that is correlated with your wallet address.**

**At the top right, you'll see three buttons. Click "Send" to
[send ETH](https://bitski.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410791516692-How-do-I-send-currency-)
to another wallet of your choice in 3 simple steps.**

All you need is their wallet address and enough ETH in your wallet to cover the
associated gas fees (more on that

code. You'll need this to receive ETH or NFTs.**
