You can also use the Bitski SDK without a user wallet to read content from the
blockchain. This can be useful to display data before the user logs in, or for
basic applications that don't require a user wallet.

This feature is built into all Bitski SDKs. Just initialize the SDK as normal.
You will then be able to make read-only calls without signing in.

## Other SDKs

You can also use the Bitski node infrastructure separately from our SDK. All you
need is a client ID from the [developer portal](https://developer.bitski.com/).
Simply include your client ID as the X-API-Key header:

```js JavaSCript
var Web3HttpProvider = require("web3-providers-http");

var options = {
  headers: [{ name: "X-API-Key", value: "<YOUR CLIENT ID>" }],
};

var provider = new Web3HttpProvider(
  "https://api.bitski.com/v1/web3/mainnet",
  options
);
```
