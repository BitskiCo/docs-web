title: "Sell An NFT In Your App Or Game"

### Using your own payment system

If you have an existing payment system in your app, you can simply create an NFT
using our API based on your existing payment system. You will be responsible for
gas fees and should adjust your pricing accordingly.

### Using the Bitski payment system

<Warning>
Coming Soon

Selling an NFT directly in your app with Bitski is not supported yet, but we are
actively working on it. In the mean time you can
[embed a product](/get-started/embed-your-product) and link out to us for checkout.

</Warning>
