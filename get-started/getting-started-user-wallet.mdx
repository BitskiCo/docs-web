### Create an app

All apps that use Bitski need to be registered in our Developer Portal. We do
this to keep track of permissions a user grants you.

To register: visit our [developer portal](https://developer.bitski.com), then
click _New App_.

Once registered, you can select your new app from the list. You should now be
able to see your client id.

### Configure your client settings

Once you create your app, you'll need to configure the OAuth settings for it.
You can do this from the OAuth tab under your app details page in the developer
portal.

The most important setting here is the redirect url(s). We use this to ensure
that only the domains you approve can get access tokens for your client id.

See Client Settings for more information on all these settings, .

### Integrate with your app

Now that you have a configured your app on Bitski, you can start using our SDKs
in your app.

A great place to start for new web-based apps is our Quickstart Truffle Box.

You can find more details on integrating with your app by reviewing the
instructions for the particular SDK you're using:

- [JavaScript](https://github.com/BitskiCo/bitski-js)
- [iOS](https://github.com/BitskiCo/bitski-ios)

For web-based apps, you'll need to be able to respond to the callback from our
servers.

It's also important to consider the user experience for the various states your
user will be in. Our SDKs can tell you whether or not the user is currently
logged in. You should then update your UI based on that information.

### TLDR

```js JavaScript
import { Bitski } from "bitski";
import Web3 from "web3";

// Host https://github.com/BitskiCo/bitski-js/blob/main/packages/browser/callback.html on https://myapp.com/callback.html
const bitski = new Bitski("CLIENT-ID", "https://myapp.com/callback.html");

const provider = bitski.getProvider();
const web3 = new Web3(provider);

// public calls are always available
const network = await web3.eth.getBlockNumber();

// connect via oauth to use the wallet (call this from a click handler)
await bitski.signIn();

// now you can get accounts
const accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();
```
