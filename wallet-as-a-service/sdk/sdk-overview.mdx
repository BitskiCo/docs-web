title: "SDK Overview"
---

Bitski's JavaScript SDK is a standalone library which makes it easy to connect your Dapp to Bitski's OAuth2 
authentication/authorization flow, and provides users a well-known interface for interacting with Web3 via username 
and password. 

Unlike other Web3 SDKs, Bitski doesn't have an opinionated approach to interacting with EVM-based chains
like Ethereum, and works generally as a provider for any Web3-compatible library. 

### Example Usage
Below includes examples of signing in with Bitski via our SDK and leveraging our provider to sign a message via the most common
EVM-based libraries today.
