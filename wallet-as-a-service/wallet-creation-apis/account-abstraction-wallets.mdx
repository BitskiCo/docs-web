### What is ERC-4337?

ERC-4337 is a smart wallet standard on Ethereum. The standard can be deployed
on any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain and allows for a new
Ethereum account capable of arbitrary verification logic.

### How Does ERC-4337 Work?

The new object introduced by the ERC-4337 standard is called `UserOperation`.
When a user initiates a `UserOperation`, it is sent to an entirely separate
mempool from the one used for processing transactions on the Ethereum mainnet.

Using a separate mempool allows these accounts to bypass the normal Externally
Owned Account (EOA) rules without affecting Ethereumâ€™s underlying system and
affords more transaction flexibility.

One benefit is you can perform multiple transactions at once, and you can also
pay gas fees on behalf of your users.

Finally accounts can be configured to require multiple signatures and keys can
be added and removed in a standard way to allow fine control over how keys are
created, managed, and recovered.
