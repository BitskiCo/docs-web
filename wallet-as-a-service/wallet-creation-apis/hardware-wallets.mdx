If your product allows users to use hardware wallets like [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com),
you can use the [wallet experience](/wallet-as-a-service/wallet-experience-apis)
and [NFT](/wallet-as-a-service/nft-apis) APIs to build great experiences.

If you want to offer your users a simpler experience as a stepping stone to
managing their own keys, you can also use the hosted hardware-backed wallet via
the [wallet creation flow](/wallet-as-a-service/wallet-creation-apis/hosted-hardware-wallets).

### Create a view-only account for the user-protected key.

You can record the user's public address to associate the wallet with the user.

```shell Create View Only Account
curl -X POST https://api.bitski.com/v2/blockchain/accounts \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>" \
-d '{
  "kind": "view",
  "coinType": 60,
  "address": "0x3ef0bd6d0f917b303bdc0404e119d9dccb070d5c"
}'
```

## Example

The Bitski [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bitski/feejiigddaafeojfddjjlmfkabimkell)
