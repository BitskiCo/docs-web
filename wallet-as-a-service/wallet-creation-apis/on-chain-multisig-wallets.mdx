<Note>
On chain wallets can be complicated to manage, contact sales@bitski.com for
help getting set up.
</Note>

If you have on-chain wallets built with [Safe](https://docs.safe.global/) or
other on-chain multi-sig wallets, you can use the [wallet
experience](/wallet-as-a-service/wallet-experience-apis) and
[NFT](/wallet-as-a-service/nft-apis) APIs to build great experiences.

You can use Bitski programmatic wallets as one of the signing addresses as a
hardware-backed hosted key. See the [JSON RPC](/wallet-as-a-service/web-3/web3-get-started)
APIs for examples.
