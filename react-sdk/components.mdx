To ensure a smooth experience, place the `BitskiProvider` as high in your app's Component hierarchy as possible.  All of the following components must be children of `BitskiProvider`.

### **BitskiWidget**
A plug-and-play widgetâ€”no need to handle connection state.  When not connected, tapping will open the `BitskiAuth` component.  When a connection is established, tapping will reveal the `BitskiWalletViewer`.

Prefer to use this over coordinating `BitskiAuth` and `BitskiWalletViewer` yourself.

```jsx
import { BitskiWidget } from '@bitski/waas-react-sdk';

<BitskiWidget />
```

### **BitskiAuth**
Shows a menu with all the `LoginMethod`s and `Chain`s that you've configured.  This component is not currently configurable outside of those two options.


```jsx
import { BitskiAuth } from '@bitski/waas-react-sdk;

<BitskiAuth />
```

### **BitskiWalletViewer**
A view of the connected Account--including Tokens and Activity based on the address / chain.  You can toggle Tokens/Activity via the `tabs` property in `BitskiProvider`.


```jsx
import { BitskiWalletViewer, } from '@bitski/waas-react-sdk';

<BitskiWalletViewer />
```

### **Signer**

Once you submit a transaction or sign  message, the Bitski signer modal will popup  This is not a Component you can directly invoke.
