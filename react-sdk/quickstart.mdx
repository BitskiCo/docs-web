We aim to use tools you are already familiar with, mainly [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks) and [Viem](https://viem.sh) so you can focus on building your application.

To get started, create an account in the Bitski Developer portal. Follow the Web3 onboarding flow to get your Bitski `appId` and we will provide a pre-configured React snippet to get you going immediately.

## Installation

```bash
npm i @bitski/waas-react-sdk
```

## SDK Initialization

Bitski’s WaaS React SDK uses Wagmi and Viem so you don’t have to learn new tools. We support many chains—just use `viem/chains` and `LoginMethods` from the SDK. [A deeper dive is here](/react-sdk/authentication).

```ts
import { BitskiProvider, BitskiWidget, LoginMethod } from "@bitski/waas-react-sdk";
import { base, mainnet, polygon } from "viem/chains";

export const Dapp = () => {
    <BitskiProvider
        appId: '6ee158ab-0210-4aa9-90e1-fba42b4d0d71',
        callbackURL: new URL("../callback.html"),
        chains={[mainnet, base, polygon]}
        loginMethods={[LoginMethod.Email, LoginMethod.Google, LoginMethod.Wallet]}
    >
        <BitskiWidget />
    </BitskiProvider>
}
```

## Callback URL

In order for the Bitski Wagmi Connectors to work, you must provide one public callback URL with the Bitski JS SDK imported.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Logging in...</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.bitskistatic.com/js/sdk/v3.3/callback.js"></script>
  </head>
</html>
```

Say goodbye to the awkward authentication dance and get back to doing what you do best—building your dApp! If you're running into issues on how
