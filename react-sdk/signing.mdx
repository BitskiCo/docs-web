### **Chains**
If you’ve ever signed or submitted a transaction with Wagmi, then there’s nothing new to report.  Continue using the APIs you are familiar with.  [All of Wagmi’s hooks work out of the box.](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks)

```jsx
import { useSignMessageAsync, useSendTransactionAsync } from 'wagmi';

const { connector } = useAccount()
if(!connector) {
    return
}

const signedMessage = await signMessageAsync({
    message: 'Welcome to Bitski WaaS',
    connector: connector,
});
```

### Bitski Signer

Once you submit a transaction or sign message, the Bitski signer modal will popup with your branding.  This includes all of the features that Bitski Signer offers, such as simulated transactions.
